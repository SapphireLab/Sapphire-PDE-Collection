## 摘要

<!--
High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant challenges for numerical computation due to the curse of dimensionality, which limits the applicability of traditional mesh-based methods.
Since 2017, the Deep BSDE method has introduced deep learning techniques that enable the effective solution of nonlinear PDEs in very high dimensions.
This innovation has sparked considerable interest in using neural networks for high-dimensional PDEs, making it an active area of research.
In this short review, we briefly sketch the Deep BSDE method, its subsequent developments, and future directions for the field.

## 1·引言

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools for modeling a wide range of natural and engineering phenomena.
However, developing numerical algorithms to solve high-dimensional PDEs has long been a formidable challenge.
Traditional mesh-based methods, which rely on specific choices of basis, inevitably face the notorious "curse of dimensionality".
Consequently, practical algorithms for tackling high-dimensional problems have been very limited.
The work~\cite{HanE2016deepcontrol} was the first to adapt the deep learning framework to solve high-dimensional scientific computing problems, with a focus on stochastic control problems, an area closely linked to Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDEs.
Shortly after, the work~\cite{EHanJentzen2017,HanJentzenE2018} introduced the Deep BSDE method, a practical algorithm capable of solving nonlinear PDEs in very high dimensions (hundreds or even thousands) for a broad class of problems.
This method was the first numerical approach based on modern deep learning to effectively address general nonlinear PDEs in high dimensions, opening new possibilities across various disciplines that require solutions to high-dimensional PDEs.
Since its introduction, the use of neural networks to solve PDEs has become one of the most active research areas in applied and computational mathematics.

The following sections provide a brief summary of the Deep BSDE method, review the subsequent advances it has inspired, and discuss future prospects for research in high-dimensional PDEs.
