## Abstract

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful class of mesh-free numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly those involving complex geometries.
In this work, we present an innovative Extended Interface Physics-Informed Neural Network (XI-PINN) framework specifically designed to solve parabolic moving interface problems.
The proposed approach incorporates a level set function to characterize the interface, which can be obtained either directly or through a neural network solution.
We conduct a rigorous a priori error analysis for the XI-PINN method, providing error bounds for the approximation.
Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we further demonstrate that XI-PINN achieves a faster training convergence rate compared to conventional PINN approaches.
The method's versatility is further demonstrated by its application to the Oseen equations. 
We perform comprehensive numerical experiments to validate the efficacy, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed framework.

## 1·Introduction

Interface problems arise in many scientific and engineering models that involve multiple materials with different chemical or physical properties (see [^Greengard1994On], [^Sussman1999Efficient,] and references therein).

In these models, the computational domain is composed of subdomains that are separated by smooth curves (or surfaces) known as interfaces.

The interface geometry itself may involve certain dynamics, i.e., the interface between different subdomains varies in time.

The low global regularity of the solutions and evolving interface bring challenges to numerical simulations, in particular, when the interface has large deformations.

Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d, d\in \mathbb{N}$ be a fixed bounded domain and $\Omega^+(t)$ and $\Omega^-(t)$ are two sub-domains of $\Omega$ partitioned by the evolving interface $\Gamma(t)$ on a time interval $[0,T_{\text{end}}]$ (see Fig.~[Sketch of domain](#Sketch of domain) for an illustration).

In this paper, we consider the following parabolic equation:

$$
\label{eq1.1}
	\left\{

$$
\begin{aligned}

	\partial_t u - \nabla \cdot \left( \beta \nabla u\right)  &= f \quad  &&\mathrm{in}\; \Omega = \Omega^+(t) \cup \Omega^-(t), \quad  t \in [0, T_{\text{end}}],  \\
	u\left( \cdot, t\right) &= g \quad  &&\mathrm{on}\; \partial \Omega, \quad t \in [0, T_{\text{end}}], \\
	u\left( \cdot, 0\right) &= u_0 \quad &&\mathrm{in}\; \Omega = \Omega^+(0) \cup \Omega^-(0),

\end{aligned}
$$

\right.

$$

with the jump conditions on the moving interface $\Gamma(t)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}

	[u]_{\Gamma(t)} &:= u^+|_{\Gamma(t)} - u^-|_{\Gamma(t)} = h_D, \quad t\in [0, T_{\text{end}}]  \label{eq1.4},\\
	[\beta \nabla u \cdot \mathbf{n}]_{\Gamma(t)}&:= \beta^+ \nabla u^+ \cdot \mathbf{n}|_{\Gamma(t)} - \beta^- \nabla u^- \cdot \mathbf{n}|_{\Gamma(t)} = h_N, \quad t\in [0, T_{\text{end}}]  \label{eq1.5},

\end{aligned}
$$

where {$f(x) \in L^2(0,T_\text{end}; L^2(\Omega))$, and} $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to $\Gamma(t)$ pointing from $\Omega^-(t)$ to $\Omega^+(t)$ and the restrictions of $u$ on $\Omega^+(t)$ and $\Omega^-(t)$ are denoted by

$$

	u^+ = u|_{\Omega^+(t)}\quad \text{and} \quad u^- = u|_{\Omega^-(t)}.

$$

The coefficient function $\beta$ is a piece-wise positive constant defined as follows:

$$

	\beta(\mathbf{x}, t) = \left\lbrace 
	

$$
\begin{aligned}

		&\beta^+, \quad \mathrm{for}\;\mathbf{x} \in \Omega^+(t), \\
		&\beta^-, \quad \mathrm{for}\;\mathbf{x} \in \Omega^-(t). 
	
\end{aligned}
$$

\label{eq1.6}
	\right. 

$$

Furthermore, we assume that there is a certain velocity field $\mathcal{V}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ that governs the movement of the interface, i.e.,

$$

	\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathcal{V}(\mathbf{x}, t), \quad \mathbf{x} \in \Gamma(t).  \label{eq1.7}

$$

The parabolic moving interface problem ([eq1.1](#eq1.1))-([eq1.7](#eq1.7)) appears in many applications, such as the Stefan problem [^Chen1997Simple] and the Burton-Cabrera-Frank-type model [^Caflisch2003Analysis].

For instance, $u$ represents the temperature and the $\mathcal{V}$ is computed by the flux of temperature across the interface in Stefan problems.

Under appropriate assumptions concerning the initial, boundary and jump conditions (see Section~[sec3](#sec3) for detailed discussions), it can be proved that Eqs.([eq1.1](#eq1.1))-([eq1.7](#eq1.7)) admits a unique solution $u$ belonging to the space $L^2(0, T_{\text{end}}; H^1(\Omega))$.

It is well known that the moving interface problems pose significant challenges for numerical simulations due to the computational domain itself evolving.

When employing traditional finite element methods (FEMs), we must ensure the generation of body-fitted meshes conforming to the interface; otherwise, the accuracy of the numerical solution will be destroyed (c.f. [^Babu{\v{s}}ka2000Can]).

Chen and Zou [^Chen1997Simple] conducted a study on the linear FEM on nearly fitted quasi-uniform meshes and proved optimal order error estimates up to some logarithm factors.

In general, mesh regeneration should be minimized or avoided whenever possible, as mesh generation is notoriously laborious and time-consuming, particularly for complex interface geometries and higher-dimensional PDEs.

Consequently, arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian methods [^Lan2020Finite] and space-time finite element methods [^Tezduyar1992New] were proposed to solve this difficulty.

To completely eliminate the need for mesh generation in solving PDEs, unfitted methods have captured significant attention from researchers over recent decades.

Unfitted methods allow the interface to cut through mesh elements, while special techniques are required to incorporate jump conditions across the interface with these methods.

To handle interface-cutting elements, a class of methods enforces the jump condition by computation schemes such as {CutFEM [^Burman2015CutFEM], [^Chen2023Arbitrarily]} and IPFEM [^Huang2017Unfitted].

Another class of methods aims to construct specialized basis functions within interface elements, designed specifically to satisfy the interface jump conditions, such as GFEM [^Babu{\v{s}}ka1983Generalized], [^Zhang2022Condensed], XFEM [^Dolbow2001Extended], IFEM [^Li1998Immersed], [^Adjerid2024High].

Guo \cite {guo2021solving} presented the first discrete analysis and optimal error estimates for backward Euler IFEM for parabolic moving interface problems.

All the aforementioned methods are effective for solving interface problems and eliminating the need for body-fitted mesh regeneration at each time step.

However, they still require careful handling of small cut elements [^Chen2021Adaptive] near the interface or the construction of basis functions [^Adjerid2024High] within interface elements that satisfy the jump conditions. 

Solving interface problems via deep learning methods has attracted extensive attention in recent years.

As a mesh-free method, neural networks are particularly well-suited for addressing problems in computational domains with complex geometries and higher-dimensional settings.

Deep learning methods effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality and eliminate the need for handling solution meshes.

The well-known PINNs [^Raissi2019Physics-Informed] and DeepONet [^Lu2021Learning], along with various improved methods  [^Tseng2023Cusp-Capturing], [^Hu2022Discontinuity], [^Wu2022Inn], [^Ying2024Accurate], [^Wu2024Solving], [^Bi2025XI-DeepONet], have been successfully used to solve elliptic interface problems, yielding promising results. 

However, solving the parabolic interface problems with neural networks remains unexplored to date.

In this paper, we aim to develop an improved PINN method called the {Extended Interface PINN} method for solving parabolic interface problems based on the extended variable technique (EVT)[^Tseng2023Cusp-Capturing], [^Hu2022Discontinuity], and derive the corresponding a priori error estimates.

The EVT enables solving interface problems effectively using only a single neural network, thereby avoiding assigning an independent neural network to each subdomain to approximate the solution within that subdomain.

This approach enables parameter sharing between solution functions across subdomains, leading to enhanced numerical performance.

Moreover, it can preserve the continuity across the interface if necessary \cite {li2025continuity}.

A key limitation is the requirement for an a priori defined level set function to describe the interface.

The level set function is typically obtained by solving the level set evolution equation, which presents significant challenges when no closed-form solution exists.

To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages neural networks to identify an appropriate level set function in such cases.

By ingeniously defining the neural network function and employing a temporal training strategy, our approach enables accurate approximation of the level set function.

Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis for the XI-PINN method, decomposing the total error into three components: the approximation error in the neural network space, the statistical error, and the optimization error.

Under appropriate assumptions, {XI-PINN is capable of effective approximation to the solution in Bochner space.}

Finally, leveraging the gradient flow analysis and the NTK theory, we find that XI-PINN indeed {improves} the training convergence rate compared to Vanilla-PINN for solving interface problems.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

In Section~[sec 2](#sec 2), we first present the fundamental framework of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), then introduce the XI-PINN method and propose our novel approach for solving the level set function.

In Section~[sec3](#sec3), we conduct a detailed error analysis of the XI-PINN method and introduce the foundational theoretical concepts related to the NTK.

Numerical results are presented in Section~[sec4](#sec4) to demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of XI-PINN.

Finally, we give some concluding remarks in Section~[sec5](#sec5).
